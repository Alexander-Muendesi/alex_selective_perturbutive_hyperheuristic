How to calculate the fitness of a timetable.

1. Calculate the hard constraint cost.
    - Lectures: A violation occurs if a lecture is not scheduled or 2 lectures are scheduled in the same period.
    - RoomOccupancy: Two lectures in the same room at the same period represent one violation. Any extra
        lectures in the same period and room counts as one violation.
    - Conflicts: Two conflicting lectures in the same period represent one violation. Three conflicting lectures 
        count as 3 violations, one for each pair.
    - Availabilities: Each lecture in a period unavailable  for that course is one violation.
2. Calculate the soft constraint cost:
    - Room capacity: each student above the capacity counts as 1 point of penalty
    - Minimum Working Days: Each day below the minimum counts as 5 points of penalty.
    - Curriculum compactness: Each isolated lecture in a curriculum counts as 2 points of penalty. 
    - Room stability: All lectures of a course should be given in the same room. Each distinct 
        room used for the lectures of a course, but the first, counts as 1 point of penalty.
