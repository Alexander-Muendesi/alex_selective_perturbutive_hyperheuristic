Swap: Swap two randomly selected courses or time slots to explore neighboring solutions.

Move: Move a course to a different time slot or day while ensuring all constraints are satisfied.

Room Change: Move a course to a different room while maintaining the timetable's feasibility.

Day Change: Move an entire day's schedule to another day while preserving course arrangements.

Period Change: Move a course to a different period within the same day.

Double-Shift: Assign a course to consecutive time slots on the same day to minimize the number of days it spans.

Split and Merge: Split a long course into two parts or merge two shorter courses to explore alternative arrangements.

Unassign and Reassign: Unassign a course and then reassign it to a different time slot or room.

Hill Climbing: Apply a local search technique to improve the current solution by iteratively making small changes.

Ruin and Recreate: Randomly remove a portion of the timetable and then reconstruct it using a construction heuristic.
